### Task 1: Finding the Minimum and Maximum Elements in an Array

Develop a function that determines the smallest and largest elements in an array using the divide-and-conquer approach.

#### Requirements:

- The function should accept an array of numbers of any length as input.
- Recursion must be utilized.
- The function should return a tuple containing the minimum and maximum values.
- The algorithm should have a time complexity of O(n).

#### Results:

Array: [34, -12, 0, 77, -56, 23, 99, -100, 38, 17, -35, 84, 65, -87, 28, 70, -44, 11, 92, -68]

Minimum element: -100, Maximum element: 100

### Task 2: Finding the k-th Smallest Element

Design an algorithm to locate the k-th smallest element in an unsorted array using the Quickselect method.

#### Requirements:

- The function must take an array of numbers and an integer k as inputs.
- A pivot selection strategy should be implemented.
- The entire array does not need to be sorted.
- The expected average time complexity should be O(n).

#### Results:

Array: [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15]

the 3-th smallest element: 7
